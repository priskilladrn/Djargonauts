## Backgrounds and Objective
We found difficulties while doing active listening. What happens?
Understanding jargon may not be easy for people with different backgrounds. They need to keep the conversation up while trying to understand the meaning. Jargon makes it hard to focus but also needed to communicate. Then, what can we do?

Here we go, Djargonauts. We will help you to understand all the confusing jargon and be a good listener to your partner!
